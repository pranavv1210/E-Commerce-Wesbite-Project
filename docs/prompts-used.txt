# Prompts Used for Code Generation

## Project Prompt
```
You are an expert full-stack developer. Act as my coding partner and build a **complete E-Commerce website project** for the Diligent internship challenge.

The project should be clean, modular, and production-ready, working end-to-end with all API routes functional.

### Objective
Create an E-Commerce website that allows users to:
- Browse products
- View product details
- Add / Remove products from a shopping cart
- Update quantities in cart
- Display total amount
- Basic responsive UI

### Tech Stack (mandatory)
Frontend:
- React.js (use Vite for setup)
- React Router for navigation
- Context API / useReducer for cart state
- TailwindCSS for styling

Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ORM)

Database:
- MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- Use sample "products" collection (title, description, price, imageURL, category, stock)

### Functional Requirements
Backend (in `/backend`):
- /api/products → GET all products
- /api/products/:id → GET single product by ID
- /api/cart → POST (add item), PUT (update quantity), DELETE (remove)
- /api/cart → GET current cart items (for persistence)
- Connect to MongoDB Atlas using environment variables in .env
- Include server.js entry point with Express routes configured

Frontend (in `/frontend`):
- Pages: Home.jsx, ProductDetails.jsx, Cart.jsx
- Components: Navbar, ProductCard, CartItem, Footer
- Routing: /, /product/:id, /cart
- State Management: Use Context API for cart logic (add/remove/update)
- API Integration: Use axios to communicate with backend routes

### Deliverables
1. /frontend – Full React app with working navigation and state
2. /backend – Full Express backend with all API routes functional
3. /docs/technical-architecture.md – Folder structure, API endpoints, data flow, state management
4. /docs/prompts-used.txt – List of all Copilot prompts used
5. /README.md – Setup and run instructions for both frontend and backend

### Constraints
- Should run locally with: npm run dev (frontend), npm start (backend)
- Clean code and folder structure
- Fully functional cart and product pages
- Use sample data if needed
- Complete this within 25–40 minutes
```

## Architecture Design Prompt
```
Design a technical architecture for an e-commerce website with:
- Clear separation of frontend (React + Vite) and backend (Express + MongoDB)
- RESTful API design for product operations
- Context API for cart state management
- Responsive component structure
- Modular folder organization
- Data flow documentation
```

## Backend Development Prompts

### 1. Express Server Setup
```
Create an Express.js server with:
- CORS enabled for frontend communication
- JSON body parser middleware
- MongoDB connection via Mongoose
- Product routes mounted at /api/products
- Error handling middleware
- Server listening on PORT from environment variables
```

### 2. MongoDB Product Model
```
Create a Mongoose schema for Product with fields:
- name (String, required)
- description (String, required)
- price (Number, required)
- image (String URL, required)
- category (String, required)
- stock (Number, default 0)
- timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
```

### 3. Product API Routes
```
Create Express routes for:
- GET /api/products - fetch all products
- GET /api/products/:id - fetch single product by ID
- POST /api/products/seed - seed database with sample data
Include error handling and appropriate status codes
```

### 4. Seed Data
```
Create seed data with 10+ diverse products across categories:
- Electronics (laptops, headphones, smartphones)
- Clothing (shirts, shoes, accessories)
- Books (fiction, non-fiction)
- Home & Kitchen items
Include realistic prices, descriptions, and placeholder images
```

## Frontend Development Prompts

### 1. Vite React Setup
```
Initialize React app with Vite including:
- React Router DOM for navigation
- Clean project structure (components, pages, context folders)
- Global CSS with responsive design
- Main entry point configuration
```

### 2. Cart Context
```
Create CartContext with React Context API providing:
- State: cart items array, total price, item count
- Actions: addToCart, removeFromCart, updateQuantity, clearCart
- Persist cart to localStorage
- Calculate totals automatically
```

### 3. Home Page Component
```
Create Home page component that:
- Fetches products from backend API on mount
- Displays products in responsive grid layout
- Shows loading state during fetch
- Handles errors gracefully
- Uses ProductCard component for each product
```

### 4. Product Detail Page
```
Create ProductDetail page that:
- Fetches single product by ID from URL params
- Displays full product information
- Includes quantity selector
- Has "Add to Cart" button
- Handles product not found scenario
```

### 5. Cart Page Component
```
Create Cart page that:
- Displays all cart items using CartItem component
- Shows total price calculation
- Allows quantity updates (+ and - buttons)
- Includes remove item functionality
- Shows empty cart message when no items
```

### 6. Navbar Component
```
Create Navbar component with:
- Brand/logo
- Navigation links (Home, Cart)
- Cart item count badge
- Responsive design for mobile
- Sticky positioning
```

### 7. ProductCard Component
```
Create reusable ProductCard component showing:
- Product image
- Product name
- Price formatted as currency
- Category badge
- Link to product detail page
- Hover effects
```

### 8. CartItem Component
```
Create CartItem component for cart display with:
- Product image and name
- Price per unit
- Quantity controls (increment/decrement)
- Remove button
- Subtotal calculation
- Responsive layout
```

## Styling Prompts

```
Create responsive CSS with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexbox/Grid layouts
- Color scheme (primary, secondary, accent colors)
- Card designs with shadows and hover effects
- Button styles (primary, secondary, danger)
- Form input styling
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth transitions and animations
```

## Configuration Prompts

### 1. Environment Variables
```
Create .env.example files for:
- Backend: MONGODB_URI, PORT
- Frontend: VITE_API_URL (if needed)
Include clear placeholder comments
```

### 2. Package.json Files
```
Configure package.json with:
- Appropriate scripts (dev, start, build)
- Minimal required dependencies
- Correct version ranges
- Project metadata
```

## Integration & Testing Prompts

```
Ensure integration:
- Frontend correctly calls backend API endpoints
- CORS configured properly
- Error handling on both client and server
- Loading states in UI
- Cart persistence across page refreshes
- Responsive design tested on multiple screen sizes
```

## Documentation Prompts

```
Document:
- How to set up MongoDB Atlas
- How to install dependencies
- How to run backend and frontend
- How to seed the database
- Project structure explanation
- API endpoint documentation
- Component hierarchy
- State management flow
```
